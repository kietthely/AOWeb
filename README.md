# Description
This is a web application that uses ASP.NET to establish the connection with a local database. The sample data (Amazon data) in the local database is pre-set beforehand with the script provided by my tutor supervisor. The website mimics the features what as an admin could be able to do, such as update and delete a particular row of data via the website.
# Features
Allow users to navigate between the pages in the shopping menu.
Allow users to search and modify the items in the database.
# Technologies used
The skills involved in this project are HTML, CSS, JS/D3, React.js, Vue.js, C# and SQL.
# Credit
This project is a self-project that is being done under my Unisa tutor supervisor.
